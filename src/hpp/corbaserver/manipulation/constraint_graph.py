## Definition of a constraint graph.

#  This class wraps the Corba client to the server implemented by
#  libhpp-manipulation-corba.so
#
#  Some method implemented by the server can be considered as private. The
#  goal of this class is to hide them and to expose those that can be
#  considered as public.
