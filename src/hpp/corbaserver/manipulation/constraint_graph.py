### Definition of a constraint graph.
##
##  This class wraps the Corba client to the server implemented by
##  libhpp-manipulation-corba.so
##
##  Some method implemented by the server can be considered as private. The
##  goal of this class is to hide them and to expose those that can be
##  considered as public.

    ## The graph is printed in DOT format. Command dot must be
    ## available.
    ## \param dotOut full path of the generated DOT file.
    ## \param pdfOut fill path of the generated PDF document.
    ## \note DOT and PDF files will be overwritten and are not automatically
    ## deleted so you can keep them.

    ### Create one or several node
    ## \param node name (resp. list of names) of the node(s) to be created.

    ## will be in the first node for which the constraint are satisfied.

    ##       this will be automatically set if you leave it.
    ## \note The weights define the probability of selecting an edge among all the
    ## outgoing edges of a node. The probability of an edge is \f$ \frac{w_i}{\sum_j{w_j}} \f$,
    ## where each \f$ w_j \f$ corresponds to an outgoing edge from a given node.
    ## To have an edge that cannot be selected by the M-RRT algorithm but is still acceptable,
    ## set its weight to zero.
